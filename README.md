**Metabuild** \ˈme-tə-ˌbild\ ● *proper noun* — *fr. META-, prefix "beyond, transcending" + BUILD, v. "to construct with great suffering" ● cf. alt. "Make Everything Trivial And Build Universally In Linux Dockerland" (backronym, chiefly among the sleep-deprived) occasionally pseudo-Latin "metabuildicus" — liberation from toolchain tyranny...*

1. A zero-to-hero, cross-platform build cocoon — engineered to spare developers from the Sisyphean torment of dependency management across seventeen different operating systems.

2. (colloq.) Docker-powered salvation for those who've grown weary of explaining why their code compiles on Tuesday but not Wednesday, or why Jessica's MacBook spawns binaries while Jenkins weeps.

3. Specialized refuge for the architecturally promiscuous — ARM64 here, WASM there, x86 everywhere, all from the same sanctified `make` incantation.

4. Think: Vagrant's disciplined cousin who ACTUALLY GRADUATED from build school and now runs a tight ship with Alpine precision.

## Someone has to keep the runtime honest...
> **Prerequisite:** a working installation of **Docker Instalation** (any recent 24-plus release on macOS, Windows, or modern Linux). That’s it!!! — *Now go forth and `make` without fear — your local machine remains pristine.*


## Repo Structure
To use the builtin `Makefile` structure your project as follow...

| Path | What lives here | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **`lib/`** | Git submodules only | External code; pulled shallow for speed. |
| **`sys/`** | System headers | Pretend-system roots for exotic targets. |
| **`inc/`** | Project headers | Stable API surface. |
| **`src/<app>/`** | Source trees | Each sub-dir becomes its own executable in `out/<target>/bin/`. |
| **`tpl/<template>/`** | Scaffolding Templates | `metabuild new [template] [name]` clones a template straight into `src/`. |
| **`test/unit/`** | Unit Tests | Run with pattern targets like `unit-test-name`. |
| **`test/case/`** | Case Tests | Run with pattern targets like `case-test-name`. |
| **`test/load/`** | Load Tests$ | Run with pattern targets like `load-test-name`. |
| **`out/<target>/`** | Build artefacts | Autogenerated; ignored by Git. |
| **`doc/`** | Documentation | Any docs needed to run stuff. |
| **`web/`** | Web subsystems | Should use a separate container. |
