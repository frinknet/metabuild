**Metabuild** \ˈme-tə-ˌbild\ ● *proper noun* — *fr. META-, prefix "beyond, transcending" + BUILD, v. "to construct with great suffering" ● cf. alt. "Make Everything Trivial And Build Universally In Linux Dockerland" (backronym, chiefly among the sleep-deprived) occasionally pseudo-Latin "metabuildicus" — liberation from toolchain tyranny...*

1. A zero-to-hero, cross-platform build cocoon — engineered to spare developers from the Sisyphean torment of dependency management across seventeen different operating systems.

2. (colloq.) Docker-powered salvation for those who've grown weary of explaining why their code compiles on Tuesday but not Wednesday, or why Jessica's MacBook spawns binaries while Jenkins weeps.

3. Specialized refuge for the architecturally promiscuous — ARM64 here, WASM there, x86 everywhere, all from the same sanctified `make` incantation.

4. Think: Vagrant's disciplined cousin who ACTUALLY GRADUATED from build school and now runs a tight ship with Alpine precision.

***SEE ALSO:** For peak build enlightenment, pair with **JACLibc** — because someone has to keep the runtime honest...*

*Now go forth and `make` without fear — your local machine remains pristine.*

> **Prerequisite:** a working installation of **Docker Instalation** (any recent 24-plus release on macOS, Windows, or modern Linux). That’s it!!!

## Repository layout

| Path | What lives here | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **`Dockerfile`** | Multi-stage Alpine image with every cross-compiler we care about | You never install toolchains locally. |
| **`metabuild`** & **`build.bat`** | One-shot launchers | Pull (or build) the image and drop you into `make`. |
| **`metabuild.mk`** | Matrix generator | Conjures targets like `clang-wasm`, `osx-arm64`, etc. |
| **`Makefile`** | Project rules | Builds **one binary per directory** in `src/`. |
| **`.dockerignore`** | Context diet plan | Keeps bulky things (.git, out/, IDE junk) out of image builds. |
| **`lib/`** | Git submodules | External code; pulled shallow for speed. |
| **`sys/`** | Header symlinks | Pretend-system roots for exotic targets. |
| **`inc/`** | Project headers | Stable API surface. |
| **`src/<app>/`** | Source trees | Each sub-dir becomes its own executable in `out/<target>/bin/`. |
| **`tpl/<template>/`** | Scaffolds | `make new basic mytool` clones a template straight into `src/`. |
| **`test/unit/`**<br>**`test/case/`**<br>**`test/load/`** | Three flavours of C tests | Run with pattern targets like `unit-test-parser`. |
| **`out/<target>/`** | Build artefacts | Autogenerated; ignored by Git. |
| **`doc/`** & **`web/`** | Writeups / static assets | Optional, kept outside the critical path. |

### How it works (hand-wavy edition)  
1. Launch script ensures the container exists.	
2. Inside the container, `metabuild.mk` figures out which compiler/arch pair you asked for.  
3. The top-level `Makefile` fans out over every `src/<app>/` folder and links an independent binary.  
4. Tests compile the same way, spitting coloured ✓/✗ lines.  

> We are working on a install system so you mostly can ignore this repo...
